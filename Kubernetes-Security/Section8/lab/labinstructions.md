## Creating an instance of Vault

1. Add the HashiCorp Help Repo
```
helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com
```

2. Ensure it's up to date
```
helm repo update
```

3. Install the latest version of the Vault server running in development mode. If you're running locally on minikube or another local instance, the first `helm install` will work just fine.
```
helm install vault hashicorp/vault --set "server.dev.enabled=true"
```

If you go with the `server.dev` option, the token value when logging in is `root`.

If you're running on another type of cluster, like Azure Kubernetes Service, you can use the below.

```
helm install vault hashicorp/vault \
  --set='ui.enabled=true' \
  --set='ui.serviceType=LoadBalancer'
```

4. Open up the Vault web UI by utilizing the `vault-ui` Service.

If you have a load balaner: ipaddress:8200

If you don't have a load balancer
```
kubectl port-forward svc/vault-ui 8200:8200
```

5. Enter 5 in the *Key shares* and 3 in the *Key threshold* text fields.

6. Download the keys (the option is on the bottom of the screen so just scroll down) and open the JSON file.

7. Click the blue **Continue to Unseal** button and follow the instructions.

8. To sign into Vault, use the `root_token` key in the Keys JSON file that you downloaded.

9. Exec into the `vault-0` Pod
```
kubectl exec -it vault-0 -- /bin/sh
```

11. Within the Pod, run the following command to log into Vault via the CLI and use the Root Token.
```
vault login
```

## Enabling Kubernetes Authentication In Vault.

### Enable Kubernetes Auth

1. Exec into the Pod
```
kubectl exec -ti vault-0 -- /bin/sh
```

2. Enable Kubernetes for Vault
```
vault auth enable kubernetes
```

3. Add the Kubernetes host. The Kubernetes host could be a DNS name or an IP address. For example, if you use Azure Kuberntes Service, you won't be given an IP address for the Control Plane. You'll be given a DNS name.
```
vault write auth/kubernetes/config kubernetes_host="https://$KUBERNETES_ADDRESS:443"

```

### Create A Secret

1. Create a secret in Vault
```
vault secrets enable -path=secret kv-v2
```

2. Add the secret to Vault
```
vault kv put secret/config username="helloworld" password="supersecret"
```

### Create A Policy

1. Create a policy for the secret (read-only)
```
vault policy write apptest - <<EOF
path "secret/data/config" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
EOF
```

### Create A Role

1. Create a role that helps Kubernetes authenticate to Vault.
```
vault write auth/kubernetes/role/apptest \
    bound_service_account_names=apptest \
    bound_service_account_namespaces=default \
    policies=apptest \
    ttl=24h
```

Exit out of the Pod

### Service Account

1. Create a new service account in Kubernetes that matches the Role in Vault.

```
kubectl create sa apptest
```

This SA will be used to authenticate to Vault.

## Kubernetes and Vault Annotations

This approach runs an initContainer and/or sidecar container to communicate with an external secret store.

Typically, secrets are injected into the Podâ€™s filesystem, making them available to all containers running in a Pod.

It's highly recommend to use this approach when possible. The major benefit is that it decouples the secret store entirely from the application. However, this does make the platform more complex, as facilitating secret injection is now an offering of the Kubernetes-based platform.

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginxdeployment
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: 'true'
        vault.hashicorp.com/role: 'apptest'
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-database-config.txt: 'secret/data/config'
      labels:
        app: nginxdeployment
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: apptest
      containers:
      - name: nginxdeployment
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
EOF
```

After you run the above, run a `kubectl describe pod` against the Nginx Pod and you'll see the Vault config.
