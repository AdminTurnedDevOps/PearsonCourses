# ctrlc-windows

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- fa3cfb4: Converted to `napi-rs`, and copy the built files directly into the dist folder. Also switched to `windows-rs` which is being supported by Microsoft directly. This shouldn't cause any breaking changes, but has much of the internals updated to a new setup.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 29e0b68: Switch to using the [n-api](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html) through the neon bindings. This provides more wholesale support for current and future versions of node, currently v10, v12, v14, and v16. (Previously ctrlc-windows@v1 only provided support for v10, v12 and v14.)

## 1.0.2
