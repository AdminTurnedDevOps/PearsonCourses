This value is beta-level. It can be used when the   `JobBackoffLimitPerIndex` feature gate is enabled (enabled by default). - Ignore: indicates that the counter towards the .backoffLimit is not   incremented and a replacement pod is created. - Count: indicates that the pod is handled in the default way - the   counter towards the .backoffLimit is incremented. Additional values are considered to be added in the future. Clients should react to an unknown action by skipping the rule.
