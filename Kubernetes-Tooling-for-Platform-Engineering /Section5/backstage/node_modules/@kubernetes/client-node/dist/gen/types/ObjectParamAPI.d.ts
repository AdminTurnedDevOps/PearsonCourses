Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent.

Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

     * limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent.

Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available.

This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

     * &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
