If signerName is not empty, then the ClusterTrustBundle object must be named with the signer name as a prefix (translating slashes to colons). For example, for the signer name `example.com/foo`, valid ClusterTrustBundle object names include `example.com:foo:abc` and `example.com:foo:v1`.  If signerName is empty, then the ClusterTrustBundle object\'s name must not have such a prefix.  List/watch requests for ClusterTrustBundles can filter on this field using a `spec.signerName=NAME` field selector.

The API server will reject objects that contain duplicate certificates, or that use PEM block headers.
