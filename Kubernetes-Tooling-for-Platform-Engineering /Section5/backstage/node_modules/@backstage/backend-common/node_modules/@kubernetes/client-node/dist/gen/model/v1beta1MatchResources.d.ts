For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and \"rules\" only included `apiGroups:[\"apps\"], apiVersions:[\"v1\"], resources: [\"deployments\"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.
