# `types-ramda`

**Requires at least `typescript@5`**

## Official types library for ramda

`@types/ramda` has been community driven for a long time. It is however very incomplete. The goal is this library is to improve the overall types for ramda by moving ownership in-house

The end-goal is to eventually migration this repo into the core ramda repo, but for now, so we can independently update and release new typings,
this repo will house the types, be publish to `npm` where `@types/ramda` will re-export what is here

To get a sense of what migration back into the core repo will look like, check out `ts` branch that is there now.

Please see the Github Issues page which is being used to define work left to do

## Usage

**`types-ramda` is not intended to be used directly!**

`@types/ramda` should continued to be used. `@types/ramda` re-exports what is defined here. The type definitions were moved into those repo for 2 reasons

* in-house control of all definitions
* set up work such that this repo can eventually be moved into the core `ramda` repo

### Note about semver

We cannot lock the semver to be the same as `ramda`'s since we plan on doing multiple releases to this library to progressively update the types
until they are all correct. We will keep up with minor releases starting at `0.29.0` up until `1.0.0`.

`@types/ramda` will be updated to latest of this package after every release
