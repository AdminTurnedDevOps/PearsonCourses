1. Log into GCP
2. Go to the Kubernetes Engine pane --> Clusters
3. Click the blue Create button
4. Give the cluster a name, choose your region, and the k8s version that you want (anything above 1.25 is ideal)

At this point, there are several options available. Go through each option that's available in the Node Pools and Cluster section.
