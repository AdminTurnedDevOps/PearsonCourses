## Configure Google Anthos

1. Log into GCP and go to the Anthos pane

2. Under the **Create a cluster** section, you'll see various options. For the purposes of this lab, choose to create a GKE Autopilot cluster.

If you'd like, you can also try one of the other options as well if you have an AWS or Azure account.

3. Add in the details for your cluster under:
- Cluster basics
- Networking
- Advanced settings

There isn't much needed to turn on in the **Advanced settings**, but it also wouldn't hurt if you'd like to test out any of the options.

4. You'll be brought to a page that shows the cluster is currently being created. Once created, you'll see a "register" button. Click the button to register the cluster with Anthos.

Once you go to the Clusters tab in Anthos, you'll now see your cluster available.
