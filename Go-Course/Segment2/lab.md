Write and run the code in the following directories:
- `basicfunction`
- `constants`
- `directory_structure`
- `moreadvancedfunctions`
- `variables`

Ensure to use the code that is in the directories as a starting point, but write out the code instead of copy/pasting it. This will ensure the process is validated and you the hands-on experience.
