## Labs Segment 4

Write and run the code in the following directories:
- `Breaks-And-Continues`
- `conditionals`
- `Loops`
- `Slieces`

Ensure to use the code that is in the directories as a starting point, but write out the code instead of copy/pasting it. This will ensure the process is validated and you the hands-on experience.
